## Description
This repository contains my first practice projects in **Semantic HTML** and **Tailwind CSS** as part of the **ALX Frontend Development** program.  
It focuses on learning how to structure web pages properly, improve accessibility, follow best practices in HTML, and set up Tailwind CSS for responsive styling. This project provides a hands-on introduction to Tailwind CSS by building responsive and visually appealing layouts. It covers configuration, responsive design, flexbox and grid integration, and professional styling practices to help me master utility-first CSS for modern web development.
